# Flames' Discord Bot
Very much still in development.

This discord bot has functionality for MTG card lookup, Twitch Streaming stuff, and more
when its added.


Planned features:
- better logging, log to file if error, log to console if debug
- Store cards after they've been retrieved then search that json before sending off
- deep info after first info
- Price lookup (maybe purchase integration)
- Card lookup - oracle text, legality
- Banlists
- Appearance in decks used in, say, pro tours and gp top 8s,and ability to fetch and price up the whole deck
- Price and demand graphing
- Price spike alerts/reminders

Notes:
- prices are taken from scryfall which is updated 
  once per day, eventually taken from individual sources
